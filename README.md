# Earth's Stress Change Over Time

Apart from tectonic causes, stress changes on the Earth could also be caused by many external forces. We establish a preliminary database of the loading-induced stress changes on the Earth, by considering five forces that would generate stress changes on the Earth: hydrological loading, atmospheric pressure, ocean tides, solid Earth tides and postglacial rebound (PGR). Please refer to the article in the reference list for details about the methods and the parameters used in the stress calculation.

* pdf file named **manual_for_stress_change.pdf** is a manual about the details of the directory, file and data format of the calculated stress.
* tar file named **hydro_xxxx.tar** contains calculated stress caused by hydrological water at the year of xxxx.
* tar file named **air_pressure_xxxx.tar** contains calculated stress caused by atmospheric pressure at the year of xxxx.
* tar file named **ocean_tide.tar** contains calculated stress caused by ocean tide for four diurnal (K1, O1, P1, and Q1) and four semidiurnal (K2, M2, N2, and S2) tidal constituents.
* tar file named **PGR.tar** contains calculated stress rate caused by postglacial rebound (PGR).
