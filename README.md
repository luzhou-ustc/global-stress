# Global Stress Changes due to Surface Mass Loads

We establish a preliminary database of the loading-induced stress changes in the Earthâ€™s interior on a global scale from 2003 to 2014, by considering five forces that would generate stress changes on the Earth: hydrological loading, atmospheric pressure, ocean tides, solid Earth tides and post-glacial rebound.
