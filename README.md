# Loading-Induced Earth's Stress Change Over Time

Apart from tectonic causes, stress changes on the Earth could also be caused by many external forces. We establish a preliminary database of the loading-induced stress changes on the Earth, by considering five forces that would generate stress changes on the Earth: hydrological loading, atmospheric pressure, ocean water (including tides and non-tidal variation), solid Earth tides and postglacial rebound (PGR). Please refer to *Lu et al. (2018)* for details about the methods and the parameters used in the stress calculation.


***The stress fields are output at 1x1 degree grids, at both surface and different depths. Curruntly, the github only stores 5x5 degree results, since 1x1 degree results are too large in memeory to be stored here. The 1x1 degree results will soon be uploaded at another repertory.***

* **hydro_xxxx.tar**: contains calculated stress caused by hydrological water at the year of xxxx.
* **air_pressure_xxxx.tar**: contains calculated stress caused by atmospheric pressure at the year of xxxx.
* **ocean_tide.tar**: contains calculated stress caused by ocean tide for four diurnal (K1, O1, P1, and Q1) and four semidiurnal (K2, M2, N2, and S2) tidal constituents.
* **PGR.tar**: contains calculated stress rate caused by postglacial rebound (PGR).
