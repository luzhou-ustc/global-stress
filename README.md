# Earth's Stress Change Over Time

Apart from tectonic causes, stress changes on the Earth could also be caused by many external forces. We establish a preliminary database of the loading-induced stress changes on the Earth, by considering five forces that would generate stress changes on the Earth: hydrological loading, atmospheric pressure, ocean tides, solid Earth tides and post-glacial rebound.
